# Create robot control panel application.

I created a web page in HTML format containing a control panel (controller) for the robot, then I created a mobile application linked to the web page to control the robot using the phone.

As you can see in the file, there are options to control the movement of the robot, which are: forward, backward, right, left, and stop.
